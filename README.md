This is the first HW challenge that was presented to us.  I refactored the HTML code to make it more accessible and provide more semantic HTML elements.  Also, I made sure the links on the page as well as the icons are all visible and working throughout the website.  The CSS was also consolidated and cleaned up.



# Mentions
I worked with a tutor for this assignment through the tutoring session for help and guidance.
